# Challenge 16: Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of Amazon Vine Analysis

This project analyzes the Amazon reviews of the furniture data by Vine (paid) and non-Vine (unpaid) reviewers. The goal is to determine if there's a bias towards more higher ratings by Vine reviewers when compared to non-Vine reviewers.

## Amazon Vine Analysis Summary

The results of the analysis indicate a possible, small bias towards more five-star reviews by Vine members (54% vs. 47%). However, the number of Vine reviews is 0.749% of the overall reviews available for analysis, which makes drawing observations of bias inconclusive. 

Since the goal is to determine if Vine users are biased towards more positive reviews, analyzing additional Amazon review datasets (other products) would likely improve the accuracy of determination of a bias between the Vine and non-View users. The recommendation is to augment this project by performing the same analysis on all of the Amazon review datasets available.
