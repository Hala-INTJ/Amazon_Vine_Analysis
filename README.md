# Challenge 16: Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of Amazon Vine Analysis

This project analyzes the Amazon reviews of the furniture data by paid and unpaid Vine reviewers. The goal is to determine if there's a bias towards more higher ratings by paid Vine reviewers when compared to unpaid non-Vine reviewers.

## Amazon Vine Analysis Summary

The results of the analysis indicate a possible, small bias towards more five-star reviews by Vine members (54% vs. 47%).  However, the number of Vine reviews is 0.749% of the overall reviews available for analysis, which makes drawing observations of bias inconclusive. 

Since the goal is to determine if Vine users are biased towards more positive reviews, analyzing additional Amazon reviews datasets (other products) would likely improve the accuracy of determination of a bias between the Vine and non-View users.  The recommendation is to augment this project by performing the same analysis on all of the Amazon reviews datasets available.
